    <h1>Privacy Policy for Show Last Image</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the Show Last Image application (the "App"). 
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal 
        data is not collected, stored, or shared in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>
        - The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, process, or share any personal data, images, or user activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        - The App does <strong>not</strong> require an internet connection and does not transmit any data externally.
    </p>
    <p>
        - No analytics, tracking, or third-party services are used in the App.

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The App may request permission to access your device's storage to display the most recent image, 
        but this access is strictly limited to that functionality. No data is collected or stored by the App.

        This App does not use any third-party services that collect user data.
